A test project used to learn angular before actually starting the project for Riskchallenger.

#definitions
Workspace: A collection of Angular projects typically in the same git repository.

# install angular cli, so we can create a workspace
```npm install -g @angular/cli```
it will ask if you want to share anonymous data, agree if you want or not if you dont.

### creating the workspace
```ng new riskchallenger-test```
It will ask for some settings you would like to use, for now just accept the defaults. 
This command can take a while.

Now cd into it. 

### starting the server
``ng serve --open``
after that is done you should now see a browser window open with the app running on port 4200. 

On this page you see a lot of next steps, that might be interesting for you, check out for example the components and testing.
